## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Clipboard.** A new tab with the last 20 things you copied. Click one to copy it again.
  Passwords from password managers are skipped, and the history is never saved to disk.
- **Notes.** A new tab with a quick scratchpad. It saves as you type and stays open while you
  write. Press Escape or click outside to close it.
- **Focus sessions.** Tap Focus in Home for a 25 minute session. When it ends, the notch offers a
  5 minute break, then the next session. You can change both lengths in Settings.
- Start Focus from the menu bar too.

### Changed
- The quick timers in Home are now 5, 10, 15 and 30 minutes, to make room for Focus. The 1 minute
  timer is still in the menu bar.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-10-21

### Added
- **File Tray.** Drag files onto the notch and drop them on Tray to keep them handy. Drag them
  back out whenever you need them, double-click to open, right-click for more.
- **Mirror.** A quick camera preview in the notch so you can check how you look before a call.
  The camera only turns on while you're looking at it.
- **Calendar.** Your next event shows up in Home, and the notch gives you a heads up 5 minutes
  before it starts.
- **Shortcuts.** Pin up to 4 of your shortcuts to Home and run them with one click.
- **Volume and brightness.** The notch shows the level when you change them.
- **Battery level** in Home.
- **Hover to open.** With "Expand on hover" on, resting on the notch opens Home.
- Home now has tabs (Home, Tray, Mirror) and a new layout: wider and shorter, with your music on
  the left and everything else next to it.
- A new Home tab in Settings to turn each of these on or off.

### Changed
- Dropping files on the notch now gives you two choices: Tray or AirDrop.
- The app asks for camera access only when you open Mirror, and calendar access only when you
  click Connect.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-21

### Added
- First release. The notch grows to show music, timers, calls, charging, low battery,
  headphones and AirDrop.
- Small, Medium and Large sizes, plus width and thickness fine-tuning.
- Pitch black look so the extension blends into the notch.
- Optional floating pill style.
- Menu bar icon, Settings window, open at login.
